A tutorial on how to use [OneMap](https://github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap) and the accompanying software [fullsibQTL](https://github.com/augusto-garcia/fullsibQTL).  

These R Markdown files were written to accompany lectures in the course "Genetic Mapping", taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the spring of 2021.

- [Part 1](http://shbrainard.github.io/files/onemap/onemap-1.html) introduces the package, and demonstrates how to form linkage groups using a dataset from an F1 apple population.

- [Part 2](http://shbrainard.github.io/files/onemap/onemap-2.html) uses this same apple dataset to illustrate how recombination frequencies estimated between biallelic SNPs, and then ordered within linkage groups.

- [Part 3](http://shbrainard.github.io/files/onemap/onemap-3.html) demonstrates how multiallelic markers are more informative in determining marker order and phase using a dataset from an F1 family of clownfish.

- [Part 4](http://shbrainard.github.io/files/onemap/fullsibQTL.html) again uses the F1 apple population and the genetic maps constructed using onemap to demonstrate the use of the companion QTL mapping software fullsibQTL.
