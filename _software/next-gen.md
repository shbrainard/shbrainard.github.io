Software for working with Illumina data and high-density molecular marker datasets

- [gbsTools](https://github.com/shbrainard/gbsTools) is a program written in Java for demultiplexing paired-end Illumina data in a manner that retains sample-specific barcodes using fuzzy-matching.

- [OneMapTools](https://github.com/shbrainard/OneMapTools) is a fast conversion algortihm to generated the input files required by [OneMap](https://github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap) from a VCF file of multi-allelic molecular markers.
