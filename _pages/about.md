I am a plant breeder and geneticist, combining high-throughput phenotyping methods and next-generation sequencing data to improve perennial woody crops in the Upper Midwest.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Dawson Lab](https://dawson.horticulture.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am developing genomic prediction models to improve the efficiency of selection in American hazelnut (<i>Corylus americana</i>), a native shrub. 

I also work at the non-profit organization [Savanna Institute](https://www.savannainstitute.org/), where I am helping to assemble large germplasm respositories for a number of perennial species that could be cultivated within agroforestry farming systems.
